[center][b][u]Welcome to the Spring Tide Clan's Hatchery![/u][/b]
My name is [b]Nerk[/b]! 
All of my dragons for sale will have 'code names' for easy reference, but will come [b]Unnamed[/b]. 
Old Breeders that are for sale will be named. 
If you would like to be my Affiliate, just ping me! I'd love to look at your Hatchery and add you too! I've got codes way down below for you to link to.

[*][b]06/16/19[/b]: I GRADUATED!!! XD
[*][b]05/18/19[/b]: Another year gone by. School's getting close to finishing, and I'm back as a coping mechanism, ha. Trying to polish the Hatchery with graphics and breeder cards made by me and that are free. (Way down below is a post with free graphics listed). I may or may not become active again, as I flow with how school is going. Having a lot of fun though.
[*][b]06/03/18[/b]: Holy moly! I'm back from a very long hiatus. Been working on updating the Lair with graphics I'm making myself. At some point in the next few weeks it will be back up and running! 
[*][b]01/20/16[/b]: The Lair has officially moved to the Ice Flight!! [i]Hopefully[/i] soon I'll get some updated graphics for the Hatchery so it's not as warm and watery. All of my Water Subspecies pairs will still breed/be active, they just won't be so [i]official[/i] anymore. 
[*][b]11/05/15[/b]: New pairs coming soon!! Rocky Cove Water Subspecies  and Poison/Toxin Snapping Gators! See Previews below in my pairs lists! Just need a few more genes and they'll be ready to breed! Edit: The Snapping Gators are now a part of the official Water Flight Subspecies Project!!! 
[*][b]09/29/15[/b]: School started last week. Bear with me as my time for FR has shortened considerably!
[*][b]08/19/15[/b]: Out of town for 10 days. Will have hatchlings for sale in my Lair, but will be unable to post them to this thread. Check them out there if you're interested!
[*][b]07/12/15[/b]: New Breeder cards added!! 
[*][b]07/6/15[/b]: Hatchery Page's 1st Day!! Woohoo!!
